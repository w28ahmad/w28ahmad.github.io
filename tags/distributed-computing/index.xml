      <description>If you are unsure of the implementation, you can find the source code of my consistent hashing algorithm here.
What is Consistent Hashing? Imagine we are running a large web service that serves millions of requests every hour. Now this web service serves the client by making HTTP requests to a backend, which in turn uses a database(s) to query data and return it to the client. Now, when you are using a web service, you will often return to the same page as you browse the web service, which means you will be making redundant calls to the database.</description>
