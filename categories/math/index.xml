      <description>Overview Machine Learning and AI is all the talk these days in engineering communities. AI in recent years achieved a great mile stone, it can now defeat any individual in any board game ever conceived by humans. Fully autonomous cars are coming closer reality with every passing year. So now is a good time as any to start to learn what is machine learning all about. The post will go through some of the core properties of neural networks such as Forward Propagation and Backward Propagation with some mathematical rigour.</description>
