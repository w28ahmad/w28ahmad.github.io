      <description>Pipe and Filter Suitable for application that require a defined series of independent computations Components reads streams of data and on its inputs and produces streams of data on its outputs Components: called filters apply local transformation to their input streams and often do their computing incrementally so that the output begins before all input is consumed. Connectors: called pipes serve as conduits for the streams, transmitting outputs of one filter to inputs of another</description>

      <description>Overview Object oriented design patterns are fundamental to programming, they are reusable solutions to common problems during programming. Often make heavy use of interfaces, information hiding, polymorphisms and intermediary objects. There are 3 main categories of design patterns that will be discussed in this blog:
Creational Patterns Structural Patterns Behavioral Patterns Other engineers have faced issues while developing applications and so they have come up with specific design patterns. We can leverage their knowledge in our own software design to simplify the process.</description>

      <description>Overview Machine Learning and AI is all the talk these days in engineering communities. AI in recent years achieved a great mile stone, it can now defeat any individual in any board game ever conceived by humans. Fully autonomous cars are coming closer reality with every passing year. So now is a good time as any to start to learn what is machine learning all about. The post will go through some of the core properties of neural networks such as Forward Propagation and Backward Propagation with some mathematical rigour.</description>
